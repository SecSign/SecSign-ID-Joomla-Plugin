SecSign ID Joomla Plugin
===========================

Use the SecSign ID two-factor authentication on your Joomla site to enable easy and secure login using your iPhone or Android phone.


SecSign ID - The mobile way to log into web sites

SecSign ID is a plugin for real two-factor authentication (2FA) for Joomla sites. 2FA adds another layer of security to your website by using a second token. In this case the physical token is your smartphone. 
If you seek for more information about about two-factor authentication have a look at <https://www.secsign.com/two-factor-authentication/> or at the SecSign blog <https://www.secsign.com/two-factor-authentication-vs-two-step-verification/>.

* Integrate SecSign ID into your own Joomla site in less than one minute.
* You and your users can also use SecSign ID to visit securely other web sites (e.g. <https://portal.secsign.com> for true professional messaging and cloud sharing.)
* This service is free for users and website owners and free of advertising - no matter how many users you have.
* You can also integrate the SecSign ID as inhouse solution into your existing infrastructure (on request with licensed service and maintenance contract)

There are also APIs for PHP, Ruby, Perl, Python and Java as well as plugins and modules for Wordpress and Drupal.
A complete overview about available plugins and APIs can be found at <https://www.secsign.com/plugins/>.
